        <h3 class="charles-overview-title">Overview</h3>
        <div class="charles-overview-text">
          I have graduated with a Bachelor degree in Robotics and Micro-Engineering (Which means engineering of small things, like mechanical or quartz watches, robot vacuum cleaners or even regular blenders) from the Swiss Institute of Technology in Lausanne.<br>
          I am currently supposed to be attending classes for a Master degree in production technologies and management.<br>
          I have started coding at the age of 12, first to install games on my Texas Instruments graphic calculator, then in C to try to find a statistical way to win the lottery.<br>
          My other passion is horse-riding, and particularly polo, which I had to put in parentheses to focus on my studies and making me a situation.<br><br>
          My next plans in life are to move to California. I like to think that I have a certain sense of design, more colorful and unconventional than the nowadays black and white standard. I have now developped my coding skills toward higher level languages, Objective-C, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Rails and Matlab.<br><br>
          I would be glad to hear about any interesting idea or project. If you would like to contact me, feel free to use this website!

          Onesnap is a mobile payment system that can be used for fast and painless checkouts on eCommerce websites.<br>
          If you want to buy something on a website, just pull out your smartphone and scan the QR code on the screen. The checkout (shipping / billing addresses) and payment is done for you.<br>  
          You also get an instant confirmation on your smartphone and on the webpage.<br><br>
          With a single app you can pay on your computer, tablet, and on your phone (directly through the app this time).

          Intown was a smartphone app project that won several prizes in startup idea contests. <br>The team was composed of Jean-Charles Gasche, Aur√©line Grange and Pablo Klemm. <br>
          Intown is a smartphone application that allows you to buy drinks and show tickets for your friends, wherever they are in the world. Let's imagine you are in Switzerland and hear about a friend being in New York. You now remember a really cool rooftop bar you went to and where the bartender did those incredible cocktails with Cognac and Martini! Your friend should definitely go to that bar! <br><br>
          (1) You pull out your phone, you select the bar in the app, and buy that precise cocktail in the list that appears.<br>
          (2) Your friend receives a QR code on his phone to present to the bartender.<br>
          (3) Your friend enjoys his drink!
